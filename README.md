# 💹 Financial Data Scraping and Analysis

## 📌 Introduction

This project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of **scraping**, **cleaning**, **analyzing**, and **predicting** financial data using cutting-edge tools and machine learning techniques. Financial data from sources such as **MoneyControl**, **IBM Cloud**, **Economic Times**, and **Yahoo Finance** was collected to extract key indicators like revenue, stock trends, and news sentiment. The cleaned data was used to detect patterns, analyze volatility, and correlate market events with price fluctuations.

Predictive modeling was carried out using **LSTM** for stock price forecasting and **Random Forest** for revenue prediction. The final output includes visualizations, insights, and model results.
